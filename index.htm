      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I live in Woking with my wife and two young daughters, who keep life
        delightfully chaotic. At work, I focus on building great user-facing
        products, leading the frontend community, and helping engineers and
        managers do their best work. I care a lot about fast and painless
        experiences — and about building a culture that's supportive,
        collaborative, and dare I say, even a bit fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2017, I've been at Secret Escapes, leading cross-functional teams
        and supporting both product and engineering growth. Before that, I
        worked at PA Consulting, where I tackled projects for clients across
        industries — including a year as a wearable tech specialist, back when
        everyone thought Google Glass was about to change the world. I also
        spent time at the startup Smarta, and did my placement year at Goldman
        Sachs. I studied Computer Science at the University of Bath, graduating
        with a First — back when jQuery was considered cutting edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside work, I'm a keen black-and-white photographer (colour blindness
        makes that less of an artistic choice and more of a necessity), a
        drummer with a love for anything with a good groove, and a fan of
        over-engineered side projects (like building my own baby monitor). I
        also appreciate a good cup of tea, a bad pun, and am a sucker for a
        gadget.

      <h2>A Note About This Website</h2>
      <p>
        Despite having years of experience in web development, I had ChatGPT
        generate this site. It's a little experiment in delegation,
        automation—and perhaps a test of whether AI can style things better than
        I ever could on a Friday afternoon.
      </p>

      <h3>Editors Note #1</h3>
      <aside>
        This comment refers to a
        <a href="archive/v1.htm" target="_blank"
          >previous version of this web page</a
        >.
      </aside>
      <p>
        Well, that was an experience. Like pair programming with a puppy very
        excited and eager to please, but very easily distracted and not always
        actually doing what it said it was going to do. ChatGPT was admittedly
        not the right AI tool for this job as it seemed to want to rewrite the
        entire thing every time I prompted and it'd just change other random
        things along it's way. Often just loosing entire sections, or adding in
        random dead links to the nav. We went on a few side quests with a
        dark/light mode slider, but it just looked ugly and it kept putting the
        labels the wrong way round until I gave up. At one point we had an
        animated lava-lamp style blob background but it just looked weird … but
        honestly this ones on me, I don't know what I expected to happen with
        that prompt. I think the icing on the cake for this experiment is it's
        passing comment about doing better that I'd do on a Friday evening … for
        the record, it's Thursday today, but ChatGPT keeps thinking it's Friday,
        and I don't want to be the one to break the bad news.
      </p>
      <h3>Editors Note #2</h3>
      <p>
        After some initial disappointment with ChatGPT I thought I'd try a
        'proper' coding assistant, and went with Cursor. I have to say the
        experience was significantly better. I believe the visual design is
        better, it managed to implement a light/dark mode toggle well. I then
        tried to get it to animate between the two which did result in a few
        issues it was unable to fix and I had to go in and manually debug/tweak,
        but it was quite happy working across multiple files which I have found
        on other project GitHub Copilot struggles with. For now I am pretty
        impressed with Cursor, and it can do a lot of the grunt work of coding
        for you, however I have confidence that my coding skills aren't obsolete
        yet!
